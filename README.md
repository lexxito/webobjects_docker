# WODockerApp
## _WebObjects deployment in Docker with everything in single image_

The goal of this project is to show how WebObjects application can be run in Docker containers. The base and insparation for this particular case is coming from work of [alextu](https://github.com/alextu/wodocker). This deployment showcasing how you can run all WebObjects components together with your application in single container, in this case you operate classical WebObjects deployment with single host.

## Demo App
For demonsration porposes was created simple ant based application which includes:
 - 1 WebServerResource
 - 1 external library(JUnit)
 - 1 simple junit test

Application versions:
 - java11
 - WebObjects 5.4.3
 - Wonder 7.4

build.xml mostly autogenerated with some additions to execute junit test before packaging. 
Application's session is stored in coockies and the page is showing hostname of instance where it is running.

## Docker Images 

### woantenvironment
This image contains all WebObjects and Wonder Framewrods as well as WebObjects specific jars needed for application compiliation. It is used as preloaded image where application can be packaged into woa porject. 

### woallinone
This image is based on already [existing Dockerfile](https://github.com/alextu/wodocker/blob/master/Dockerfile) just with updated java and wonder versions. It includes apache2.4 with WebObjects Adaptor, JavaMonitor and wotaskd.

### Quick Start
To run application for demonstration porposes simply use docker-compose
```sh
docker-compose up
```
This command will crate container where you can access following endpoints:
 - _localhost:56789_ interface for JavaMonitor
 - _localhost/apps/WebObjects/wodockerapp.woa_ demo application which is alrady running due to SiteConfig.xml
