# WODockerApp
## _WebObjects deployment in Docker with everything in a single image_

The project aims to show how WebObjects applications can be run in Docker containers. The base and inspiration for this particular case are coming from the work of [alextu](https://github.com/alextu/wodocker). This deployment showcases how you can run all WebObjects components together with your application in a single container, in this case, you operate classical WebObjects deployment with a single host.

## Demo App
For demonsration porposes was created simple ant based application which includes:
 - 1 WebServerResource
 - 1 external library(JUnit)
 - 1 simple junit test

Application versions:
 - java11
 - WebObjects 5.4.3
 - Wonder 7.4

build.xml is mostly autogenerated with some minor changes to execute the JUnit test before packaging. 
The application's session is stored in cookies and the page is showing the hostname of the instance it is running on.

## Docker Images 

### woantenvironment
This image contains all WebObjects and Wonder Framewrods and WebObjects specific jars needed for application compilation. It is used as a preloaded image where the application can be packaged into a _woa_ project. 

### woallinone
This image is based on already [existing Dockerfile](https://github.com/alextu/wodocker/blob/master/Dockerfile) just with updated java and wonder versions. It includes apache2.4 with WebObjects Adaptor, JavaMonitor and wotaskd.

### Quick Start
To run the application for demonstration purposes simply use docker-compose
```sh
docker-compose up
```
This command will create a container where you can access the following endpoints:
 - _127.0.0.1:56789_ interface for JavaMonitor
 - _127.0.0.1/apps/WebObjects/wodockerapp.woa_ demo application which is already running due to SiteConfig.xml
