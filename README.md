# WODockerApp
## _WebObjects ant deployment in Docker with minimal about of components_

The project aims to show how WebObjects applications can be run in Docker containers. This deployment showcases how you can run your WebObjects application on Docker on multiple hosts with a minimum amount of components and docker native scaling options.

## Demo App
For demonsration porposes was created simple ant based application which includes:
 - 1 WebServerResource
 - 1 external library(JUnit)
 - 1 simple junit test

Application versions:
 - java11
 - WebObjects 5.4.3
 - Wonder 7.4

build.xml is mostly autogenerated with some minor changes to execute the JUnit test before packaging. 
The application's session is stored in cookies and the page is showing the hostname of the instance it is running on.

## Docker Images 

### woantenvironment
This image contains all WebObjects and Wonder Framewrods and WebObjects specific jars needed for application compilation. It is used as a preloaded image where the application can be packaged into a _woa_ project. 

### Quick Start
#### docker-compose
To run the application for demonstration purposes simply use docker-compose
```sh
docker-compose up
```
#### Docker Swarm
The application can be also run in the docker swarm mode. In this case, you would be able to scale your application instances easier. 
```sh
docker swarm init
docker stack deploy -c stack.yml webobjects
```
Each of these commands will create a stack with services that expose following endpoints:
 - _127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/WebObjects/wodockerapp.woa_ demo application which is already running.
